# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## 1. Project Overview
### Background
We've been tasked with determining the number of employees retiring per title and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. To do both we will use SQL to make a database of all of the employees and using the query tool to compound all of the employees into the proper tables.
### Purpose
This code serves as the queries made to the SQL database. Included is the code for the tables that set up the database and the data used to fill the initial tables. The goal of these queries and tables is to create tables with filtered data to determine retirement elegibility and mentorship eligigibility.
## 2. Results
### Retiring Titles:
- Senior titles are the prominent titles withing the retirees, which makes sense as with age comes experience and longer careers.
- Leardership roles are also prominent for the same reasons.
- Assistant Engineers are less prominent as it would make sense as one does not usually retire as an assistant.
- Surprising lack of manegerial positions retiring, or perhaps it is due to promotions to a higher offices not recorded in the .csv files.

### Mentorship Eligibility:
- There is a major decrease in the total number of mentorship eligable persons in comparison to the retiring group.
- The difference in number of mentors in comparison to the number of retirees can be explained by the range of birth dates.
